                Introduction
            </h3>

            <p>
                In the modern world of technology, being able to communicate well is crucial, 
                especially when you want to connect with employers, recruiters, or people checking out your portfolio website. 
                A great way to make this communication even better is by adding a live chat feature. 
                In this blog post, I'll show you the steps of how I added AWS Connect, a cloud-based contact center service, 
                to my portfolio website. 
                <br><br>
                Amazon Connect is an omnichannel cloud contact center. You can set up a contact center in a few steps, 
                add agents who are located anywhere, and start engaging with your customers.
                <br><br>
                This made the chat experience more personalized and efficient.

            <h3>
                Step 1: Setting Up an Amazon Connect Virtual Contact Center Instance 
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                I started with creating an Amazon Connect virtual contact center instance from the AWS console. 
                Each instance contains all the resources and settings related to your contact center. 
            </p>
            <img src="img/blog3.png" alt="Description of the image">
            <p>
                I added the domain from which chats will be initialized, specified admins to access the instance, and data storage for the instance.

                Step 2: Designing the Customer Experience Flow 
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                Once the virtual contact center is set up, I logged in to create a flow, 
                A flow defines the customer experience with your contact center from start to finish. 
                Amazon Connect includes a set of default flows so you can quickly set up and run a contact center. 
                However, you may want to create custom flows for your specific scenario.
            </p>

            <p>
                My customed flow includes a welcoming automated message when someone starts a chat and places them in a queue until 
                I join the conversation from the agent workspace.            
            </p>

                Step 3: Creating Rules for Notifications 
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                To ensure I never miss a chat request, I established a rule in AWS Connect. <br>
                A rule is an action that Amazon Connect automatically performs, based on conditions you specify. <br>
                This rule triggers an automatic email notification whenever someone is placed in the queue, 
                giving me real-time alerts and enabling prompt responses.

                Step 4: Generating a Communication Widget
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                The communication widget, aka the live chat widget, 
                is a crucial component. I configured it by selecting the flow 
                created in Step 2 and customized its style to align with the aesthetics 
                of my portfolio website.

                Step 5: Implementing the JavaScript Code
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                With the configuration complete, AWS Connect generated a JavaScript code 
                for the communication widget. Implementing this code into my frontend was 
                a breeze â€“ a simple copy-paste action seamlessly integrated the live 
                chat functionality into my website.

            Integrating AWS Connect's live chat widget into my portfolio website has not 
            only added a professional touch but has also significantly improved 
            communication with my audience. By following these simple steps, you too can 
            enhance your website's functionality and create a more engaging and responsive 
            user experience.
